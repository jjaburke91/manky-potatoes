,Grey Gardens,1975,x,,,x,,x,,,,,,,,Ellen Hoyde,,👍,
,In The Loop,2014,,,,x,,,,,,,,,Peter Capaldi,Armando Ianucci,Very funny political comedy from Glasgow legend Armando Ianucci,👍,
,Dark Days,2000,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Doc detailing the homeless living in tunnels under NY,👍,
,Jojo Rabbit,2019,,,,x,,x,,,,,,,"Scarlett Johanssen, Sam Rockwell",Taika Waititi,Young Nazi who's imaginary friend is Hitler finds hiding Jewish girl in house,👍,"Enjoyable & funny watch, loved the casting. Yorki (Jojo's best mate) stole the show for sure - totally adorable. Interesting portrayal of WW2 in a very Waititi style - colourful, silly and a bit slapstick at times. Marmite reviews but up for lots of awards."
,Lady Bird,2017,,,,x,,x,,,,,,,Saorsie Ronan,Greta Gerwig,,👍,
,"Synecdoche, New York",2009,,,,x,,x,,,,,,,Philip Seymour Hoffman,Charlie Kaufman,,👍,"Can't make my mind up on this. A totally draining, miserable, bleak and ultimately tragic film. Can't quite call it beautiful as it just felt so joyless, but there is defintely some grand sense of _something_ in it. Powerful, I think. But it felt fucking long, and it was only 2 hours length. Hoffmann is amazing in it. Very art-house and one for people who like films abstract and high in concept, certainly surreal. Sort of explores what it means to be human, and looks into how similar we all are, how we're all struggling and on the planet together. Life that exists before birth and after death is a strong motif throughout it (amongst many other motifs). Explores the human condition for sure, but unlike so many other films or stories that do, this doesn't leave any sense of joy or happiness, but perhaps it is meant in some way. Slept on it a lot, it's difficult to watch this film but it's concept is strong enough that it's stood out as a good flim, also a film with joy can still have value."
,Vice,2018,,,,x,,x,,,,,,,"Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Steve Carrell",Adam McKay,,👍,Dick Cheney is a monster. Christian Bale is amazing
,1917,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,👍,
,Beautiful Boy,2018,,,,,,x,,,,,,,"Steve Carrell, Timmy Chalamet",Felix van Groeningen,,👍,"wasn't enjoying the first half but film definitely turned a corner. Seemed a bit inauthentic at times, hard to believe timmy chalamet as a drug addict and some of the scenes of drug taking were just a bit meh.  Pace, build of tension and general belief in the characters does build - at the beginning thought it was a contender for first 'cancelled' but stayed with it and worth it"
,Boyhood,2014,,,,,,x,,,,,,,,Richard Linklater,,👍,
,Cabin In The Woods (not Cabin Fever),2011,,,,,,,x,,,,,,,Drew Goddard,"Reputably a good horror movie, Chris Hemsworth before he blossomed",👍,"Once you accept and get used to the deliberately cliche dialogue, it's a FUN film that totally plays around the horror genre and continues to shift and flip the expectations through the film. Can see why it's often referenced as it's one of those few films that succeeds in throwing total surprises into the mix. Film pans out into something totally different from where it starts. Don't expect anything that's genius, just a solid fun film good for a hangover."
,Boy,2010,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Taika Waititi,"NZ boy's estranged father returns to him and his brothers and step-brothers, where 'Boy' discovers Dad isn't all he was cut up to be.",👍,"Taika's earliest film and most modest. Much more focussed on his very trademark with and dialogue than his other films - there aren't any spectaculare plotlines or scenes. Funny, charming and heartwarming much like all his others films. More of what you already expect of him, good but wasn't blow away by it personally."
,Free Solo,2018,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,Jimmy Chin,,👍,"Well told, fascinating character. Good subject matter. Nerve wracking."
,Goodfellas,1990,,,,,x,x,,,,,,,"De Niro, Joe Pesci, Ray Liotta",Martin Scorsese,Classic gangster movie,👍,
,Icarus,2017,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,Bryan Fogel,Doc maker stumbles into uncovering the state-sanctioned doping conspiracy,👍,"Amazing story uncovering the lengths Russia will go to to win in international sporting. Protagonist Grigory R is extremely lovable, despite what he had done for most of his life."
,Joker,2019,,,,,,,,x,,,,,Joaquin Phoenix,Todd Philips,,👍,"Didn't need to see killing of Batman's parents - I get it already, batman and joker are nemesis. Scene dancing on the stairs killed the malaise and dread the film built up so well, would love to see the film without and that playful and amusing segment so the film's dread just builds up until the finale. Tone down the batman connections a little bit, too many. Phoenix ridiculously good, physical acting too."
,Moneyball,2011,,,,,,x,,,,,,,"Brad Pitt, Jonah Hill",Bennett Miller,True-life story of a baseball manager's attmept to redefine the game with statistics.,👍,"Well performed film (really liked Jonah Hill) explaining details of a complicated system quite well, not so dissimilar to The Big Short (same director). Overly twee at times, namely the ending and some of the sports moments. Generally a really interesting story."
,Sleepaway Camp,1983,,,,,,,x,,,,,,,Robert Hiltzik,Cult slasher,👍,Genuinely terrifying ending. haunted in sleep. Rest of film very okay.
,Foxcatcher,2014,,,,,,x,,,,,,,"Steve Carrell, Channing Tatum, Mark Ruffallo",Bennett Miller,Real life story of psycho wrestling manager.,👍,cba
,Capote,2005,,,,,,x,,,,,,,Philip Seymour Hoffmann,Bennett Miller,"True-life story of famous author Truman Capote, establish an unlikely friendship with a killer whilst he researches a murder case for his famous book In Cold Blood.",👍,"Helps greatly to have read In Cold Blood before-hand, as the film really adds so much more detail to the story of how the novel was put together. Fascinating to witness how close and comitted Capote was to the killers and how constructed the story. It's a slow-moving film and fairly serious, Seymour-Hoffman is amazing in it, anothe film reminding of how great an actor he was."
,John Wick,2014,,,,,x,,,x,x,,,,Keanu Reeves,Chad Stahelski,,👍,So many cliche lines. great trash action film.
,Call Me By Your Name,2017,,x,,,,x,,,,,,x,"Armie Hammer, Timmy Chalamet",Luca Guadagnino,,👍👍,
,Being John Malkovich,1999,,,,x,,x,,,,,,,"John Cusack, John Malkovich, Cameron Diaz",Spike Jonze,,👍👍,just mad
,Audition,1999,,,,,,,x,,,,,,,Takashi Miike,Very famous (cited as best ever by some) psychological japanese horror.,👍👍,"90% romantic drama with subtle creepy elements and the final 10% being psychopathic torture-gore. Can see why it's so famous, the massive build up of the first 90% of the film leading to the final 10% lands pretty well and had me gawking during hte last 20 or so minutes. Very creepy elements that stick with you as well after for the torture scene. Eesh. Worth a watch if you're in the mood for a japanese horror and want to know the cult films of the genre."
,Honey Boy,2019,,,,,,x,,,,,,,Shia labeouf,Alma Har'el,,👍👍,Interesting portrayal of father/son relationship that is tumultuous and affecting - based on Shia LaBeouf's childhood. The actor playing young Shia is v good. Writing accurately shows the dynamic in a disfuctional family where often it's the kid that has to be the mediator/responsible one and is old before their time.
,Silence Of The Lambs,1991,,,,,,,,x,,,,,"Jodie Foster, Anthony Hopkins",Jonathan Demme,,👍👍,it's a classic and whats his face is a great character. Whats her face is great too.
,The Lighthouse,2019,,,,,,x,x,,,x,,,"R-Patz, Willem Dafoe",Robert Eggers,same director as The Witch,👍👍,Defos needs a second watch for it to sink in. Both watched totally agahst at the weird scenes that were playing out. An unexpected horror. Some scenes are burnt into my eyes. WD and R Patz both amazing.
,Capernaum,2018,,,,,,x,,,,,,,,Nadine Laba,Story of a child's struggle in war-torn Beirut.,👍👍,"Maybe my favourite film of 2018. Harrowing, wasn't a dry eye in the cinema. Very well directed and acted by Syrian refugee child-actor. Touches heavily on topics of poverty, refugees, child poverty and human behaviour in desparation. One of the core plot elements (child sueing his parents) is pretty ridiculous, but not too hard to overlook. Highest possible recommendation, but prepare yourself for an a cry."
,No Stone Unturned,2017,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,Alex Gibney,Documentary uncovering secrets kepy by the government during the troubles,👍👍,"Totally shocking, gives a great general insight into the NI Troubles which personally I knew nothing about. Delves into the grey areas around certain murders carried out by the UVF, and the level of police and gvt collusion and purposeful mismanagement of investigations. Amazing investigative journalism, and mix of witness / narration to tell the story."
,Se7en,1995,,,,,,,,x,,,,,"Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kevin Spacey",David Fincher,,👍👍,"Good pace, good gore, Brad, Morgan and Gwenny at their peak, wet and miserable city sets an uncomfortable scene and stands the test of time. Who knew it was actually Kevin Spacey. Ending is a stonker."
,The Irishman,2019,,,,,x,x,,,,,,,"Robert Di Nero, Joe Pesci",Martin Scorsese,,👍👍,"Peak performance from Robert De Niro, possibly his best. Joe Pesci incredible in it too, definiteliy one of his best also. Slightly too long perhaps but I think the length vitally contributes to the emotional impact of a couple of immensely powerful scenes, both owned by Robert De Niro. Slightly different to other Scorscse gangster films in that it seems to glorify gangster lifestyles much less. Get use to the facial augmentation of their younger selves pretty quick, looks great. Embaressing there is almost 0 lines from a women though, how can a 3+ hour film go with basically no female lines it's bloody madness. "
,Parasite,2019,,,,x,,x,,x,,,,,,Bong Joon-ho,,🥔🥔🥔,"One of those few films that plays around with it's genre-format, switching between expectations as the film progresses. Funny, dramatic, playful and serious all at once. Really excellent film, one of the best of 2019 "
,For Sama,2019,x,,,,,,,,,,,,Hamza Al-Khateab,Waad Al-Khateab,Won best doc at cannes 2019 and loads of other awards. Harrowing,🥔🥔🥔,"Harrowing no-filter story on the brutality of war, genuinely haunting scenes. Savage window into the human spirit in the most dire of situations. Easily one of the most upsetting things I've ever seen. Amazing the director was capable of holding a camera up to so much of this. Made me dream of rivers of blood :D"
,The Fly,1986,,,,,,,x,,,,,,Jeff Goldblum,David Cronenberg,,🥔🥔🥔,"Gorey and funny, such a sick 80s horror. Best bit when his jaw falls off."
,The Thing,1982,,,x,,,,x,,,,,,Kurt Russel,John Carpenter,,🥔🥔🥔,Best kind of 80s gore effects that are as funny as they are horrifying. The trust games that play out are great and the contentious ending is KILLER. Totally deserved of it's reputation as one of the best horrors ever made.
,Pi,1999,,,,,,,,x,,,,,,Darren Aronofsky,Won the cannes award in the 90s,😐,
,Behind The Curve (Flat Earthers),2018,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,Daniel J. Clark,Flat earthers doc,😐,Mildly interesting. Too long as all Netflix docs seem to be now.
,Creepshow,1982,,,,,,,x,,,,,,Leslie Neilson,George A Romero,Debut Screenplay from Stephen King. Series of short films and spooky happenings.,😐,"Really weird tone between slapstick and scary, never quite doing either. Leslie Neilson's short as a psycho killer is ace though. WHERE'S MY CAKE?"
,Diego Maradona,2019,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,Asif Kapadia,,😐,"Interesting but lacking moment of emotional impact. Not a huge amount of footage from 'behind-the-scenes' like Amy and Senna, it was 90% him playing football. Felt like there was a vital aspect missing of sorts, perhaps caused by the fact he is still living and surely some secrets are still kept under wraps. Nice film but incomparable to Senna and Amy."
,Escape From New York,1981,,,x,,,,,,x,,,,Kurt Russell,John Carpenter,"Classic John Carpenter film and iconic dystopia from the early 80s. Set in new-york-turned-giant-prison where all of America's criminils are sent, Air Force One crashes within it and anti-hero good guy gone bad Snake Plissken is sent in to save him in exchange for a pardon for his crimes. Fun Fact: This Snake has a crazy long list of characters that were inspired by him, including Snake from the Metal Gear series.",😐,"If The Warriors and Indiana Jones made a baby, and that baby had a baby with The Rock (film) and some cowboy western it would be this. Very 80s action movie including John Carpenter soundtrack and slow pacing. It's a silly concept and movie played out seriously, particularly amusing from Kurt Russel. Not a funny movie, straight action dystopia. Stands above many because of how great the world is and how well the mood of it is played out."
,The Two Popes,2019,,,,,,x,,,,,,,,Fernando Meirelles,,😐,"Enjoyed the character portrayal and performances are great, but definitely pretty dissapointing upon reading how false much of it is. Overly romanticising their relationship, but still an enjoyable story if you can embrace the potential falsehood. Really enjoyed how much character and personality it gave to priests - people who I think are often lost of character."
,mid90s,2018,,,,,,x,,,,,,,,Jonah Hill,Coming of age tale of a young teenager finding a community in local LA skateboarders.,🙅,"Quite dull and definitely dragged on. Directed pretty well, enjoyed the style of it all and did well to achieve the nostalgia of 90s skateboarding, but in the end felt there was little substance, new or affecting in the film. It's not without it's cliches either. Also suspiciously close story to one of the best documentaries ever Minding The Gap - any comparison to that film is perhaps why I'm being so critical of mid90s."

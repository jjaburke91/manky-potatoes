A totally draining, miserable, bleak and ultimately tragic film. Can't quite call it beautiful as it just felt so joyless, but there is defintely some grand sense of _something_ in it. Powerful, I think. But it felt fucking long, and it was only 2 hours length. Hoffmann is amazing in it. Very art-house and one for people who like films abstract and high in concept, certainly surreal. Sort of explores what it means to be human, and looks into how similar we all are, how we're all struggling and on the planet together. Life that exists before birth and after death is a strong motif throughout it (amongst many other motifs). Explores the human condition for sure, but unlike so many other films or stories that do, this doesn't leave any sense of joy or happiness, but perhaps it is meant in some way. Slept on it a lot, it's difficult to watch this film but it's concept is strong enough that it's stood out as a good flim, also a film with joy can still have value.","_type":"film","_id":"2009_synecdoche_new_york"}
